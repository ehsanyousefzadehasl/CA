# Computer Architecture
In this repository, I keep the files and notes and other stuff that I worked with them while watching prof. onur Mutlu Computer Architecture courses. I try to write here what I enjoyed learning them.

I made it modular becuase I felt the notes are getting so lengthy. So, just navigate through notes on different sessions by the following links.

[Session 1](session01/session1.md)

[Session 2](session02/session2.md)

[Session 3](session03/session3.md)
